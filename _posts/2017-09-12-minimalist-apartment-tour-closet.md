Two months ago we sold our 1,800 square foot home and moved into a 1,100 square foot apartment. We gave up about 700 square feet, an unfinished basement, and a backyard. How has our family adapted to our new home?

I am happy to say that we have transitioned just fine. We really aren’t lacking in space due to our minimalist lifestyle. Our old home has 4 closets, 1 linen closet, and an entry bench with hooks. Our apartment has two 2 large closets, a laundry closet, an entry closet, and a linen closet. This apartment isn’t lacking in storage ability and we are only using a fraction of it. Here is a look at our closets:

## Laundry Closet

Our laundry closet is in the hallway, centrally located between our bedrooms and the main bathroom. Instead of just using this closet as a laundry room, I found myself wanting to hang up our clothes in this closet as I pulled them out of the dryer. So, I made this the laundry/family closet. I can wash, dry, and put away clothes all in one place, making my life super easy right now. Here is a breakdown of what’s in our closet:

On the top shelf we have my husband’s PJ pants and a pair of shorts he plans to re-wear before washing. Our sleeping bag is stored up there. And last, our bin covers are stored up there.

The lower shelf has a few folded clothing items (my winter PJ’s and my husbands shorts/pants). Next, my husband and I each have a bin that holds our underwear and socks. Next to that is my Honest Company Laundry Detergent and Lavender Essential Oil. On the other side of those, each of our girls has their own bin with underwear, socks, pants/shorts, and swimsuit.

Below the shelves to the left are mine and my husband’s clothes. On top of the washer I’ve got our laundry basket with yesterday’s dirty laundry.

To the right, above the dryer, are the girls’ clothes. Behind their clothes I have our Eagle Creek travel bags and the girls’ sleeping bag sacks hanging from hangers for easy storage.

## Entry Closet

Our entry closet is right next to our laundry closet and pretty much houses the rest of our storage. Here is the breakdown of what’s in this closet:

On the top shelf we have our humidifier. The swap.com box holds our Christmas decor items (stockings, a nativity set, 2 kids books, and ornaments). The clear bin has seasonal items (gloves, winter hats, scarves, my husband’s snow pants, goggles for swimming, and baseball caps). My girls need new snow pants this winter so those will be added in a month or two.

The lower shelf houses some of our shoes - Chris’s black dress shoes, his moccasins, his sandals, his winter boots, and my winter boots. The shoe box currently holds all three girl’s summer flip flops. And my heels are stored on top of the box.

Hanging in our entry closet from left to right: picnic blanket, my backpack, Chris’s backpack, and then each of our winter jackets.

On the floor from left to right we have a large level, our safe, vacuum cleaner, girls’ shoes, girls’ winter boots. Shoes we are currently wearing we store next to the front door for easy on and off access. Same goes for the girls’ backpacks.

_That’s a wrap for the closet tour. Our linen closet is empty. We keep our girls’ bedroom closet empty. The master bedroom closet has Chris’s black suit for special occasions, his 2 button down shirts that he currently doesn’t wear, and a sweater we will move to the laundry closet when it gets cold outside._

_Next post, I’ll tour our bathrooms!_
