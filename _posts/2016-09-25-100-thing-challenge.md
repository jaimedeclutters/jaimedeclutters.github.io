How many personal items do you own? This includes your clothes, shoes, jackets, hats, toiletry items, cell phone, charger, bike, sleeping bag… the list can go on and on! What do you think your number is? My number and list are below.

I read Dave Bruno’s [The 100 Thing Challenge](http://amzn.to/2cUnRi1) in less than 24 hours. I loved his honesty about why we accumulate things and our struggles to let go. Maybe we really wanted something as a child and so we try to satisfy our younger self as an adult or maybe we have an image of who we want to be and buy things to create that (but not actually become that).

He talks about his journey in his challenge. He also defines his challenge. His 100 items would be his own personal items. So anything he shared with his wife or kids didn’t count (such as his bed, piano, dishes). He made the challenge a bit easier by making socks collectively an item and underwear collectively an item instead of counting the pairs individually. His favorite books counted as 1 library. He could also buy things as long as he stayed under 100 things total.

The entire time I was reading this book I was thinking about my own items. How many do I own? I have decluttered a lot (A LOT) over the past few years. I knew I didn’t have a ton, but still - was it 100 items? When I counted my personal items - items I don’t share with my family - I came up with 84 items!

# My Counting Journey

As I was going through my items. I found a few things that I no longer use and added them to my Goodwill donation box or threw away. These items included: a baseball cap, a watch, a comb, a brush, and a second armband for my phone.

Because I found my list was decently smaller than 100, I decided to count out items I could have made a bulk item (socks, bras). I don’t own many clothes and am happy with that - though I do plan to add 1 or 2 pairs of jeans, a pair of mittens, and a new long sleeve shirt in the near future (making my list 88 items).

While I share my bed with my husband, I don’t like sharing my pillow so I put that on my list (just ask my husband, he likes my pillow, and I don’t like to share). I have a camping sleeping pad but the sleeping bag is not on my list because the sleeping bag is a double that my husband and I share.

I don’t wear a lot of make up so my list there is short. I didn’t include my engagement ring because we sold it earlier this year ([read about that here](https://www.keepthrifty.com/2016/03/23/engagement-ring-sold.html)). I included a full length mirror, even though I could say I share, because it was honestly a splurge item I have in my bedroom that I love.

And the oddest thing on my list is probably the Disney wristband. We visited Disney World last year and I am hoping our family will visit again soon so I guess I’m keeping the wristband for now.

# Your Turn

Would you be willing to take the 100 Thing Challenge? If you are interested, but overwhelmed by the idea, that’s ok. Start with one category - probably clothes. Go through your clothes and count out your items (declutter along the way). Then move onto another room, closet, or drawer. Maybe make your own rules that make sense for your life.

> If you would like help decluttering, maybe even getting down to 100 personal items, I would be honored to help you reach your goal. Life is so much more than the items we own. If you are holding onto items because they are suppose to make you a runner, rock climber, woodworking artisan, or camper but deep down you know that those things really aren’t you - it is ok to say goodbye to that dream and make room for something that truly speaks to your heart and goals.
