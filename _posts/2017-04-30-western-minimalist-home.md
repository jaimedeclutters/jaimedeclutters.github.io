I’m definitely a minimalist when it comes to my home. I like clean lines and a spacious airy feeling, but to add a little more character, I love the idea of adding eclectic hints to bring texture and color. There are so many great ethnicities and lifestyles you can feature in your home. Today, I bring you out West. So if you are a cowboy fan, I have got some great ideas for you in this post!

## Family Memories

When we accent our home with items that remind us of the people we love, it always adds a homey feeling. I love hanging special family photos and my kids art work. If you live out West or have family from out West, then maybe you have a soft spot for a cowboy accent in your home.

My grandparents use to live in Bismarck, ND. I remember going out to visit in the Summer. They loved to take us to Medora, ND. It is an amazing place to visit. We love [Theodore Roosevelt National Park](https://www.nps.gov/thro/index.htm){: target="_blank"} and the [Medora Musical](http://medora.com/do/entertainment/medora-musical/){: target="_blank"}.

My grandfather practically lived in his cowboy boots. It didn’t matter if we were going to church, going out for dinner, or taking a stroll around their neighborhood. He loved his boots. I don’t even know if he owned any other type of shoe!

This past summer, we road tripped with our girls out West. I knew I wanted to make Medora a special stop. My girls loved Medora and were sad to leave. It was really special for me to share this little piece of family history with my kids. I can definitely see us visiting again in the future!

## King Ranch Saddle Shop

I recently connected with Kristin from [King Ranch Saddle Shop](http://www.krsaddleshop.com/){: target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}. She saw my husband’s blog post about [Living In Half Our House](https://www.keepthrifty.com/2017/04/10/living-in-half-of-our-house/){: target="_blank"} and saw our home remodeling photos. She asked if we had any ideas on adding a Western vibe and she inspired me to write this post.

This post is not sponsored or have affiliate links. This post came about because I thought this would be a fun topic to write on and I thank Kristin for reaching out!

After perusing their online shop, I found a few fun items that I thought would make awesome western accents in a minimalist home.

And if you are a cowboy boot lover like my grandfather. I think this are classically cool:
