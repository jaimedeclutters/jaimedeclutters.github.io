At home I have a trash and a recycling bin. My recycling company (Advanced Disposal) accepts plastics 1-7, PET, HDPE, glass, cardboard, mixed paper, newspaper, tin, steel, and aluminum cans. Here are examples of the different plastics:

- __#1 (PET)__ - Example:	Water Bottles
- __#2 (HDPE)__ - Example: 	Milk Jugs
- __#3 (PVC)__ - Example:	Shampoo Bottles
- __#4 (LDPE)__ - Example:	Squeezable Condiment Bottles
- __#5 (PP)__ - Example:	Medicine Bottles
- __#6 (PS)__ - Example:	Take Out Containers
- __#7 (MISC)__ - Example:	Sippy Cups

If you have a plastic that seems like it fits in one of these categories, but doesn’t have the symbol and number - IT CAN NOT BE RECYCLED! This is because they won’t know how to properly process these items.

The remaining items need to go in the trash. That was, until TerraCycle found a way to recycle the “non-recyclable”. They have developed a system to recycle anything! I find this incredible and am so thankful that someone decided to dedicate time and energy to solving this problem.

## Terracycle Programs

- There are free programs funded by companies that want to support consumers in recycling their products. You can view [all the free programs here](https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades){: target="_blank"}. Many programs fill up and have wait lists. If or when you join one of these programs, you will be able to print free shipping labels to mail in your recyclables.

- The paid programs are a great option for those items you can’t recycle in the free programs. This works by purchasing a Zero Waste Box. You can view [all the box categories here](https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/zero_waste_boxes){: target="_blank"}. The more specific the box, the more affordable. Boxes come with a free shipping label to return to TerraCycle via FedEx.

I now have three collection systems at home - trash, recycling, & TerraCycle! I have personally used these boxes:

- __All-In-One Box:__ Great for those miscellaneous items!
- __Art Supplies Box:__ Empty paint tubes, tape, paint brushes, etc
- __Bathroom Separation Box:__ Human hair, razors, loofahs, etc
- __Fabrics & Clothing Box:__ Ripped clothes, blankets, etc
- __Garage Separation Box:__ Sporting goods, garden products, etc
- __Kitchen Separation Box:__ String cheese wrappers, etc
- __Toys Box:__ Broken toys, cards, packaging, etc

You will notice that the Zero Waste Boxes aren’t cheap. If you are interested in utilizing TerraCycle’s service, but feel it is outside your budget consider teaming up with a friend and splitting the cost. Another great option is to look for local TerraCycle collection boxes that are FREE to the community.
