Is your home filled with furniture - beds, dressers, tables, couches, chairs, etc? What if I said you could eliminate half of your furniture, still have everything you need, and still enjoy your home? It is possible, here is how to make it happen:

1. ___Question Expectations:___ Does a living room need end table at the ends of the couch? Does everyone need a dresser in their bedroom? Do you need a dining room and separate table and chairs in a breakfast nook? Do you need a night stand? Is your entry table, bookcases, desks, hallway console, and tv stands necessary? Instead of thinking about what you are supposed to have, ask yourself - do I use this, do I want to use this?

2. ___Let Go Of Trends:___ Instead of trying to stay on top of the latest trends, think about what you want your home to feel like, what do you picture happening in these rooms? Think about how you want to enjoy the space. Anything that doesn’t help with creating that vision - remove from the room. For example: When I picture my ideal living room, I think about visiting with friends and snuggling up with a good book. I removed my television, console.

3. ___Experiment:___  Remove the excess items from your room. Store them in your basement or in a spare room of your home. Practice living with less furniture. Give yourself at least a month to adjust to the changes. If at the end of the month, you are enjoying your new decluttered space, feel free to sell or give away your stored items. If after the month is over, you’ve missed something, bring it back. Maybe try a new layout if the first trial didn’t meet your ideals. It’s all about experimenting

4. ___Create A Clean Slate:___ Maybe the best thing you can try is clearing out the room completely and bringing everything back one by one, picking the items you want back in that room intentionally!

5. ___Consolidate:___ Maybe you have two bookcases. Do you need both? Cull through your books and keep only the ones you love and will read again. Donate the rest to your local library along with the empty bookcase. Or maybe you have two dressers. How many of these items are you just holding onto but not wearing. Consolidate your clothing down to one dresser and remove the empty one!

With these changes you’re home will feel more peaceful and you’ll feel more contentment because you have furniture you love (whether trendy or not). You may even find that with less furniture, you need less square footage to live in. You could eventually live in a smaller home, saving you money in a mortgage, property tax, and heating/cooling!
