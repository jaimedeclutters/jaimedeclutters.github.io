Two months ago we sold our 1,800 square foot home and moved into a 1,100 square foot apartment. We gave up about 700 square feet, an unfinished basement, and a backyard. How has our family adapted to our new home?

I am happy to say that we have transitioned just fine. We really aren’t lacking in space due to our minimalist lifestyle. Our old home had four bedrooms. We used two of them (our three girls shared a room back then as well) and two were empty. Our apartment has two bedrooms so I feel like we are living very efficiently.

We are still rocking the [floor sleeping]({% post_url 2017-04-05-why-we-sleep-on-the-floor %}). Chris and I added a thin memory foam mattress topper to sleep on. I was having some back pain and this seems to have solved that problem. Here’s a look at our bedroom spaces:

## Master Bedroom

Our master bedroom is just under 14 feet by 13 feet. It is seems huge to us since we don’t have much furniture, but it does have everything we need.

We have our sleeping space - a memory foam mattress topper, sheet, pillows, and comforter. That purple is from my college days!

Next to our bed we have Chris’s sit/stand desk that I found on Craigslist. When he needs to get work done and our girls are home, he retreats to our room to work. On the desk I have a white box that is housing a notebook, pen, two phone chargers, a computer charger, the book I am currently reading, and our bible study booklet.

## Girls’ Room

Our girls’ room is just under 11 feet by 12 feet. And once again, they have plenty of space for their stuff.

Each of our girls has their own corner of the bedroom with their sleeping bag, pillow, and blankets. They also have their own collection box with personal items (papers, toys, collections, jewelry, etc).

On the window ledge we have my old mini ipod and stereo for music and an alarm clock. Below the window we have a wire basket that houses all of their toys. Next to the box is a stack of library books.

Hiding behind the wire box is a metal sign that says I LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK. We have been meaning to hang that up on the wall.

In the top picture, I hang the girls’ nightgowns on the closet doors so they remember to wear them again.

_That’s a wrap for the bedroom tour. Pretty simple! Next post, I’ll tour our closets and laundry room!_
