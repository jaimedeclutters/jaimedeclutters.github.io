It feels like I haven’t written in so long. I’ve been busy taking care of sick kiddos, shoveling snow, and dealing with the stresses of life. Can you relate?

Boy, life can get so crazy. Sometimes I feel like I’m just spinning in circles until I crash - which usually triggers a spike in my depression. I end up with no energy and seeking comfort food. This inevitably makes me feel worse and the spiral continues.

I know I need to carve out time for myself to recharge. I know this will make me a better mom and wife, will fill me with energy, and bring happiness into my life. So why is this so hard to create?

One of my biggest hurdles is figuring out what actually recharges my batteries. Do you know what fills you with energy?

I’ve been trying to figure this out for years. Back when my twins were babies, I use to head to the gym when my husband got home from work. That worked well for a while, but then I stopped enjoying that routine. Then I tried going rock climbing for a hobby - that didn’t last long. This past summer I worked out with a friend in the early mornings. I enjoyed that time, but I’m not a morning person. Eventually I didn’t want to wake up early in the dark cold mornings so we stopped working out.

One thing that I really enjoyed this past summer was heading to a local coffee shop for a few hours once a week. A babysitter would come to play with my girls (which they loved) and I would get 2 hours to myself. I would get a coffee and set up my computer. That’s when I started this blog. And I loved that time!

Once school started, I fell out of that routine. I figured I would be able to write during the 2.5 hours I had while my twins were in school. I could stay in my own home, make my own coffee, and write.

But that didn’t happen. I would find myself doing dishes, laundry, baking bread, twice I got a yoga workout in, and probably twice I got on my computer to write. This wasn’t the same. There was something special about getting out of the house and being able to focus on something I loved doing without the distractions of dishes and laundry.

Now that I am writing this (in my kitchen next to my sick kiddo on her tablet), I realize that the time at the coffee shop was a special retreat for me. I should probably start that again!

Do you do something just for you that recharges you? If so, what do you do? I would love to hear what works for others! Hopefully we can encourage each other to do that one thing that brings us energy, but fail to take time for in this crazy busy life.
