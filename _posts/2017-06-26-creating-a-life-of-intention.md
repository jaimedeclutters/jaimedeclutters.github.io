What if we only did the things that brought us lasting joy? What if we were able to clear out not only the items in our life, but the actions in our life that bring us down? What if we could intentionally create a life that left us feeling fulfilled instead of exhausted?

I have spent years not living intentionally. I didn’t really know what I wanted. Actually, that’s not true. I knew what I wanted, but I pushed that aside to strive to impress the world. I took on the pressure of wanting it all and feeling like we were never going to get there, no matter how financially successful we were. I allowed impulse shopping to overshadow spending (and saving) with intention. I allowed my schedule to be filled in order to please others. In result, I found myself exhausted and feeling like I might never truly feel joy.

Then minimalism came into view. Joshua Becker defines minimalism as:

> The intentional promotion of the things that we most value and the removal of everything that distracts us from it.

## Start With The Stuff

I started with looking at the physical items in our home. I questioned everything. Every cup, plate, item of clothing, toy, and bathroom toiletry. When I did this, I found myself clearing out more than half of our home. And this has been a blessing.

Decluttering our home has opened up our life in so many ways. I find that I am content with less which means I shop less. With shopping less, I am saving our money and am able to intentionally save for the things that are most important to us - paying off our mortgage, family travel, and allowing my husband to pursue a new career.

Decluttering isn’t just about emptying your home of stuff. It’s about freeing yourself from your stuff so that you can reopen the door to your dreams and start intentionally making choices to make those dreams happen.

## Take A Leap Of Faith

It’s one thing to dream. It’s another thing to do, to take the leap. The leap is scary. What if you jump short and don’t make it to the other side? But what if you never try? If you never try, you’ll never know what could have been.

My husband and I have dreamed of a slower paced life. One that makes time for daily exercise, working on something we are passionate about, walking together to pick up our kids from school, having energy and dedicated time with our kids, family dinners, weekends of hiking and walking to church, and being able to travel freely with our kids for an extended period of time.

And now we are taking the leap. The leap of faith to pursue our slower paced life.

My husband is leaving his full-time job. We are leaving the security of a regular paycheck to start living out our dream. Along with this change, we are selling our home and moving into an apartment. Freeing up the equity in our home is allowing us to take this leap with a safety net.

My husband will be able to work on his passion, sharing our journey and helping others become more intentional about how they use their time and money to achieve their dreams, at [keepthrifty.com](https://www.keepthrifty.com/){: target="_blank"}.

And since he will be working from home, he can join me at the gym each morning and walk with me to pick up the girls from school each afternoon. He can take a break from work and spend time with me and the girls after school and get a little extra work in before bed a few nights a week.

And since we are selling our home, we will no longer have home maintenance chores filling up our weekends. We can spend that time enjoying the outdoors, hiking in the nearby state parks.

We are also looking into traveling to New Zealand in 2018, living out a dream of ours to experience living in another country for a few months.

None of this would be possible without taking this leap. And I am so excited for our leap of faith to start July 1st!

## Create An Intentional Life

The great thing about taking a leap of faith is that it forces you to become intentional.

We will have a limited budget while we are living off our home equity. This means that I will be questioning everything I spend money on - Is this adding value to our life? I’m glad that decluttering worked this muscle of intentionality because I feel much more prepared to follow through on asking this question in our leap year.

With my husband’s schedule becoming more flexible, we decided we wanted to make sure to plan for the things that are most important to us. We knew that exercise, time to work, walking to school, time with the kids, family dinners, and weekends outdoors were important to us. So my husband and I sat down and wrote down our schedule. This way we know what to expect, the girls know what to expect, and we can create a family lifestyle that brings us lasting joy.

I’m excited to share our journey during the leap year here on my blog. And if you are interested in creating a life of intention, decluttering, and taking the steps to make your dreams a reality - reach out! I would love to hear what your dreams are and talk about how decluttering can be a first step in reaching your goals.
