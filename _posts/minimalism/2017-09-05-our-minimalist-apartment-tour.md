Summer of 2017 we sold our 1,800 square foot home and moved into a 1,100 square foot apartment. We gave up about 700 square feet, an unfinished basement, and a backyard. How has our family adapted to our new home? I am happy to say that we have transitioned just fine. We really aren’t lacking in space due to our minimalist lifestyle.

Here’s a peek at our apartment:
