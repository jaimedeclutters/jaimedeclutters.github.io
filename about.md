## Here is a little bit of my story:
{: class="center"}

I have always enjoyed decluttering. I remember cleaning up my room as a kid, clearing out the items I no longer loved and depositing them in my sister’s closet or later in the unfinished basement.

Years later, when my husband and I moved into our first home together, after filling it up, I started decluttering again. I would shuffle things from one room to another, down to the basement, and eventually to Goodwill. But I was never making any lasting progress.

For every box I brought to Goodwill, I was bringing home a bag of new items. I found myself frustrated with the constant clutter, but didn’t have a solution. Then I learned about minimalism.

> The intentional promotion of the things that we most value and the removal of everything that distracts us from it.

I realized that consumerism was distracting me from my values. I started shopping less, questioning what was important to me, and soon enough I was taking boxes of stuff to Goodwill and not bringing so many new items into our home. I was making lasting progress.
With more focus on my values, my husband and I started talking about our dreams. If money wasn’t a concern, how would we want to live? Or, at the end of our life, will we look back and regret anything? If so, what and how can we change that now?

We talked about what our perfect day would look like and what it would take to make that happen. We also talked about traveling to new places together and with our three girls.

The art of decluttering with minimalism in mind, has helped us focus on what is truly important to us and to let go of all that is not. Knowing that we are happy to live simply and smaller has freed us financially to take the leap to make our dreams a reality.

This summer sold our house and downsized to an apartment. My husband left his full time job to work from home on his passion project ([keepthrifty.com](https://www.keepthrifty.com){: target="_blank"}). This will allow us to embrace a slower life and travel freely. This journey has taken us a few years, but it is all possible because I started decluttering. And I can’t wait to see where this journey continues to take us!
