I'm Jaime – a wife, a mom of 3, and a minimalist enthusiast. Here is my story:

Walking through my home a few years ago this is what you would notice. An entry closet packed with jackets, shoes, seasonal items, vacuum, mop, and various other random items. My go to was – throw it in and quick close the doors! My kitchen counters were covered in papers, dishes, anything I wanted to deal with later. Bedrooms had semi-full closets and stuffed dressers. The top of my dresser was another collection site for random clutter or clothes I would put away later. I had a dedicated playroom for my children filled to the brim with every toy – so why were they always fighting or bored? My basement was a storage site and at one time I had an extra bedroom with additonal random stuff.

Walking through my home now, this is what you will see. The entry closet is gone and in its place a bench, hooks and a few cubbies for a some seasonal items. In my living room there are three bins: 1. duplo legos, 2 regular legos, 3. board games. My girls also have a bin of dress up clothes in their room and they each have a “collection box” in their closet for their special papers or items. The playroom is now an empty room to run around in. We don't have any dressers and just utilize our closet space. Our basement is mostly empty and so is the extra bedroom.

My stress level is lower, I spend less time maintaining my home, and my kids use their creative energy playing make believe and holding dance recitals. Life isn't perfect, sure a little bit of clutter gathers, and bordem happens, but the clutter gets taken care of easily and bordem turns into dance partys.

I love the decluttering process. The freedom it brings is an amazing feeling and I would love to help others achieve this same freedom in their homes.
