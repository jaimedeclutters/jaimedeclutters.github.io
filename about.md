I'm Jaime – a wife, a mom of 3, and a minimalist. Here is my story.

Walking through my home a few years ago this is what you would notice:

* An entry closet packed with jackets, shoes, and seasonal items. My go to was – throw it in and quick close the doors!
* My kitchen counters were covered in papers, dishes, anything I wanted to deal with later
* Bedrooms had semi-full closets and stuffed dressers. The top of my dresser was another collection site for random clutter or clothes I would put away later
* I had a dedicated playroom for my children filled to the brim with every toy – so why were they always fighting or bored?
* My basement was a storage site and at one time I had an extra bedroom with additional stuff

Walking through my home now, this is what you will see:

* The entry closet is gone and in its place a bench, hooks, and a few cubbies for a some seasonal items
* In my living room there are three bins: 1. duplo legos, 2. regular legos, 3. board games
* My girls have a bin of dress up clothes in their room and they each have a “collection box” in their closet for their special papers or items
* The playroom is now an empty room to run around in
* We don't have any dressers and just utilize our closet space
* Our basement is mostly empty and so is the extra bedroom

My stress level is lower, I spend less time maintaining my home, and my kids use their creative energy playing make believe and holding dance recitals. Life isn't perfect, a little bit of clutter gathers, and boredom happens, but the clutter gets taken care of easily and boredom turns into dance parties.

I love the decluttering process. The freedom it brings is amazing and I would love to help others achieve this same freedom in their homes.
