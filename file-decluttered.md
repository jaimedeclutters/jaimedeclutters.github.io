As a minimalist, I declutter my digital home the same way I declutter my regular home. From time to time, I go through old posts and remove old content I think is no longer providing value.

I'm sorry that the page youâ€™re looking for was a part of one of those sweeps.

I do this to keep the site focused on the best content. Please check out some other posts below.
