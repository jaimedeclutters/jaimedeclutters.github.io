If you would like to declutter, but can’t seem to get started, I can help. I meet with clients in the Madison, WI area to declutter and create margin in their homes, turning a room that speaks chaos into a room that speaks joy.

I schedule decluttering for Saturdays. We set aside 4 hours to tackle a room, basement, or garage. If at the end of the 4 hours, the space isn’t completely decluttered, we will set up specific homework tasks to help you achieve your desired	outcome. Or if you would like, we can schedule another 4 hour session.

Saturday Decluttering Session: $100

Contact me to schedule your Saturday decluttering fun!
